  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="report-section">
    <h2>Welcome to Our Water Sustainability Project</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to preserve and protect water quality in the Netherlands.
      We focus on <strong>reducing nitrogen pollution</strong> in groundwater
      and surface waters by collaborating with farmers across all regions.
      By using <em>WaterCredits</em>, we aim to foster sustainable farming
      practices, ensuring a healthier environment and a brighter future for
      our communities.

  <!-- Key Insights / Purpose -->
  <div class="report-section">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High Nitrate Levels:</strong> Intensive livestock farming leads to
        nitrates leaching into water supplies, impacting water quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>WaterCredits System:</strong> A practical, market-based way for farmers
        to offset or reduce their nitrogen pollution—<em>earn credits</em> when you
        adopt greener methods, or purchase them if you exceed thresholds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interactive Tools:</strong> Our <em>Nitrogen Calculator</em>, 
        <em>Forecast Model</em>, and <em>Water Score</em> reveal how small changes can
        have a big impact on both your farm’s efficiency and water quality.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Farmers-Focused Message -->

    <h2>Empowering Farmers</h2>
    <p>
      We understand the challenges that farmers face daily—financial risk,
      market pressures, and ever-changing regulations. 
      <strong>Our tools are designed to be practical and transparent,</strong>
      showing you exactly how adjustments in feed type, manure management, 
      and grazing practices can reduce nitrogen pollution while helping you
      save on costs or earn valuable <em>WaterCredits</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By collaborating with farmers, we aim to build a future where
      <strong>responsible water usage</strong> and a <strong>thriving rural economy</strong>
      go hand-in-hand.
